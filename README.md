# Crop-Price-Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a data-driven project titled CROP PRICE PREDICTION, focused on analyzing and predicting crop prices in Rajasthan, India, using advanced machine learning models. The project leverages multiple datasets, including crop production, water usage, soil analysis, and market prices, to create an integrated model for price prediction. The repository provides a comprehensive approach to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning for multiple machine learning algorithms.
